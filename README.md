I‚Äôm a **full-stack developer** from Denmark who loves solving real problems with code. I graduated with an **AP in Computer Science** from UCL University College, Odense in June 2024, and I‚Äôve got experience in both backend and frontend development. I work with stuff like C#, Java, Python, .NET, React, and Node.js, and I‚Äôve built everything from museum games to web apps. Some of my favorite projects are [**YouTube-Viewer**](https://github.com/leaskeg/YouTube-Viewer), a bot that tracks YouTube channels, and a Unity game I made for MOSS Museum. Right now, I‚Äôm a Freelance Specialist at Outlier AI, helping train AI models with C#, Python, and Java. I‚Äôd love to team up on open-source projects‚Äîhit me up via [my website](https://www.jensbach.se) or email at [jensgudmand@gmail.com].

### üé® Featured Creations
- **Unity Educational Game for MOSS Museum**  
  During my internship, I built a Unity game for MOSS Museum to make visits more fun and educational. Using C#, I added interactive bits about sustainability, and I even got to show it off at Aalborg University‚Äôs job fair‚Äîit got some great feedback!

- **MOSS Museum Web Platform**  
  I worked as a freelancer to create a WordPress site for MOSS Museum, adding custom map plugins with JavaScript to make it more engaging. I also sped up the site by 35%, so it loads nice and quick for visitors!

- **LLM Training at Outlier AI**  
  Right now, I‚Äôm working at Outlier AI, training AI models with C#, Python, and Java. I‚Äôve been writing test cases to make the models more accurate, which feels pretty rewarding!

- [**YouTube-Viewer**](https://github.com/leaskeg/YouTube-Viewer) - A Python bot I made to track YouTube channels and post about new uploads‚Äîgreat for creators who want to stay on top of things!

- [**VVAlarm**](https://github.com/leaskeg/VAlarm) - A smart alarm system I built with Python to make waking up a bit more interesting!

- [**MossPlatform**](https://github.com/leaskeg/MossPlatform) - I put together **MossPlatform** for MOSS Museum to manage their games (which I also created in Unity). It‚Äôs a .NET app (recently updated to .NET 9). It uses C# for the heavy lifting, plus HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript to make it all come together nicely.
